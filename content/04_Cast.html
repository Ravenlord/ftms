			There is no way to describe Christian's life in just one paragraph. Over the years Christian was not only an actor, but also stuntman, bodyguard, professional diver, racecar driver and martial arts sportsman.
			As multifaceted his life is, as multifaceted his role portfolio is. Christian describes himself as "the unique actor with the special skills". And indeed he is. With his life experience he was the first choice for playing the role of Marcel Pion, the Warrant Officer Class I in the co-pilot seat, next to the main actor Wolfgang. He plays the experienced and hardened counterpart to First Lieutenant Alexander Baur.<br>
